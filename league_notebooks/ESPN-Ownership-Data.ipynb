That said, Abreu's performance in all three categories comes with some risk: He continues to show poor strike-zone judgment, leading the majors in swings at \\\\\"non-competitive\\\\\" (those considerably outside the zone) pitches in 2016; he appears to have sacrificed some power in exchange for a three-year pattern of rising contact rates; and his White Sox, now in rebuilding mode, might not provide as much fuel for his counting numbers. Abreu is no longer a likely-top-25 player and in fact might be a risky pick within the top 50, though as his baseline is probably his 2016 numbers, he's still a worthy early-round pick.\",\"seasonId\":2017,\"date\":\"Tue Feb 21\"},\"playerRater30DAY\":6.1,\"playerRater15DAY\":2.9,\"positionRank\":7}</div>]\n"
